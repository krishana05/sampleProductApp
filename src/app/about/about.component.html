      Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than
      55,000 years ago.Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of
      isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second
      only to Africa in human genetic diversity.Settled life emerged on the
      subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years
      ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third
      millennium BCE. By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European
      language, had diffused into India from the northwest, unfolding as the
      language of the Rigveda, and recording the dawning of Hinduism in
      India.The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern
      regions.
